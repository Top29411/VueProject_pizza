# vue-pizza

> A tasty Vue.js starter project. Clone, remove `vue-pizza` everywhere, and add your own features. Also, read through the wiki.

## Why?

A lot of starter projects or examples of Vue.js in the wild were: outdated, no tutorial or wiki, not comprehensive and didn't cover most of the elements necessary for real world apps. This project was started from the latest official Vue-cli PWA template and built up from there.

## Wiki

Visit the Github wiki tab [here](https://github.com/prograhammer/vue-pizza/wiki) to learn everything you need to know about
how this starter project was built (which allows you to learn and rebuild this project from scratch if you want).

## Installation

Very simple. See the Installation section in [wiki](https://github.com/prograhammer/vue-pizza/wiki).
